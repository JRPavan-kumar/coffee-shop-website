<h3>It is a one of the Relaxing method</h3>
   <h1> 9 Benefits of Drinking Tea And Coffee</h1>
<h2>1. Hydrate the Body and Replenish Your Fluid Intake</h2>
<p>While coffee can do the same, tea has the added benefit 
    of generally being just pure H2O with that nice tea 
    flavor, meaning that when it’s a scorching hot summer 
    day, it’s much more beneficial to sip down some tea (hot or cold) as it’ll replace any 
    fluids you’ve lost through sweating. It also means 
    that it’s good for your skin and gets it hydrated 
    quicker.
    </p>

<h2>2. Lower the Risk of Getting Certain Types of Cancers and Tumors</h2>
<p>
While there is no conclusive evidence that tea can help in the treatment of cancer, 
green tea does contain chemicals known as polyphenols, which are antioxidants that may help to 
prevent DNA damage by free radicals. This is why some people believe tea can help prevent or cure cancer.
Some laboratory studies have shown that tea polyphenols can inhibit the growth of cancer cells; however, 
human studies have yielded mixed results.
</p>
<h2>3. More Durable Energy Boost</h2>
<p>While tea contains less caffeine than coffee when consumed in the same amount of servings, 
    tea is high in L-theanine, which is a powerful antioxidant that also stimulates your brain.
    According to research, consuming L-theanine with caffeine — such as in tea — may help you maintain your alertness, 
    focus and sharpness.</p>
<p>In fact, a study discovered that participants who consumed L-theanine and caffeine together performed better 
on an attention test than those who consumed caffeine alone.
</p>
<h2>4. Rich in Antioxidants to Prevent Chronic Diseases</h2>
<p>
Antioxidants are molecules that help protect our cells from free radicals, which are harmful molecules.
Free radicals are naturally produced in the body, but they can also be obtained from outside sources such as pollution, 
UV radiation, and certain foods. They can damage cells and contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer, 
heart disease, and Alzheimer’s if left unchecked.
</p>
<p>
The high antioxidant content makes tea an excellent choice for those looking to improve their overall 
health and lower their risk of chronic diseases.
</p>
<h2>5. Help in Weight Loss</h2>
<p>When combined with a sensible diet and exercise, tea may help you lose a small amount of weight.
For instance, green tea contains catechins and caffeine, both of which can help boost metabolism to break 
fat down and burn calories more quickly. As a result, weight loss may eventually result from an increase in energy expenditure.
</p>
<h2>6. Good for Your Teeth</h2>
<p>Unlike coffee, you don’t have the unwarranted side effect of discoloration when it comes to drinking a reasonable amount of tea.
Besides, tea may help prevent cavities by lowering the amount of bacteria and decay-causing acid produced in your mouth.</p>
</p>
<h2>7. Protect Your Bones</h2>
<p>A study found that people who drank tea on a regular basis had stronger bones and were less likely to develop osteoporosis 
    due to the high levels of tea catechins.</p>
    <P>In addition, the bioactive components of tea have been linked to increased bone mineral density
     and a lower risk of bone fractures.</p>
<h2>8. Help Reduce Stress</h2>
<p>Research shows that after drinking tea for six weeks, there is a decrease in post-stress cortisol, 
    and an increase in subjective relaxation.[15] For example, green tea’s antioxidants and catechins, 
    for example, have been shown to reduce stress and depression.
    Besides, making and drinking tea can be a ritualistic and calming experience.
  Taking the time to brew a cup of tea and enjoy its aroma and flavor can help in relaxation and the reduction of stress.</p>
    <h2>9. Strengthen Your Immune System</h2>
    <p>In addition to having antioxidants that shield the body from free radical damage that can impair 
        immune function, tea also has anti-inflammatory properties that help to lessen inflammation and 
        support immune function..</p>
      <p> Furthermore, tea contains vitamins and minerals that are beneficial to immune function, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, 
        and zinc. These nutrients facilitate the production and function of immune cells, which are in charge of protecting 
        the body from infections and diseases.</p>
